# About

This is yet-another-implementation of the basic utilities specified by the POSIX standard, as defined here: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html

The primary goal is POSIX-compliance. Non-standard options and performance optimization will be done on an as-I-feel-like-it basis. Performance characteristics may differ from a straightforward implementation.

This project will probably never be finished and the exposed API is subject to change until further notice. PRs and issues are definitely appreciated, though.

For now, consider this code in the public domain. I'll figure out a proper license later - or if you need one now, let me know.
